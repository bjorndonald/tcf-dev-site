The profit split for the challenge is 85% which is good, however, the NET profit goes down a bit due to transaction charges incurred when TC sends the Payments to your wallet. There is also a scaling plan available",

Also,  you  only need  5 minimum trading  days.  The  best thing about Traders Central  is you  can claim daily tokens and  use those toward  your plan   where   you   could   save   up   to   50%   of   your   challenge.",
                    "What I want Trader Central to improve is to have bigger customer support and a better   system   in   putting   those   traders   who   passed   the   challenge   into   a   live account, besides waiting a couple of days where it needs to be reviewed by the risk team."
